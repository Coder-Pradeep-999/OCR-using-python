# Prerequisites - pytesseract, numpy, cv2

# Install the following modules using the "Command prompt" in windows:

To install "pytesseract": 
      pip install pytesseract
To install "numpy":
      pip install numpy
To install "cv2":
      pip install opencv-python

# IMPORTANT: 
      After installing "pytesseract" module, open the folder where tesseract is installed and add the path to "tesseract.exe" to "pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd" as a raw string.
      This helps to not deal with setting up the environment variable for "Tesseract".
